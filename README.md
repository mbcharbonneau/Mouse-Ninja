# Mouse Ninja

Mouse Ninja is an experimental tool for OS X that allows you to control your mouse cursor with the keyboard. Activate it with a keyboard shortcut of your choosing and press an arrow key. Each key press divides your screen in half. Press left, and you exclude the right-hand half of your screen. Press down, and you exclude the top. Keep going until the mouse cursor is centered where you want it, and press enter to click.
